License interpretation guide:

    GGGA can be used without restriction for personal, academic, or commercial
    use.  The AGPL will not extend to the algorithm being tuned.  The AGPL only
    applies when you modify, convey, or make available GGGA or a work based on
    GGGA.  For the avoidance of doubt, the use of Python's "import" statement
    is considered equivalent to dynamic linking.
